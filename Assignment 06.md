# Question 01

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data,
or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and 
behavior. Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being that is described by properties 
like name and address, down to small computer programs, such as widgets.
```


```python
# Question 02

The advantages of object-oriented programming lie in this kind of encapsulation.
1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting
2. Reuse of code through inheritance
3. Flexibility through polymorphism
4. Effective problem solving
5. OOP languages allows you to break down your software into bite-sized problems 
   that you then can solve â€” one object at a time.
```


```python
# Question 03

Function:
A function is a piece of code that is called by name.
It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). 
All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.

Method:
A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object.
```


```python
# Question 04

1. Class: Classes in object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects.
    (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), 
    and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). 
    The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword.
    
2. Object: In object-oriented programming (OOP), are the units of code that are eventually derived from the process.
    Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and 
    data variables.
    
3. Attribute: Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class 
    or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance.
    
4. Behaviour: The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined
    within the object class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure. Methods determine what 
    type of functionality a class has, how it modifies its data, and its overall behavior.
